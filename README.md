A small decentralized application that will allow a user to withdrawl the phazewavetoken at a certain time interval. 

That is the main case off the application. 

At the same time, a user will be able to user there metamask account to be able to login and if they own a certain nft or have a certain amount of tokens they will be able to create their own little PhazeAdapterSession where the owner of that patiricual  session will be able to deposit tokens themselfs and setup a distribution time lock that will allow a user to withrawl any time after a time period.
